# CS302HW1
Home Work 1 code for CS302



Pending tasks:
Creating header for each function and each file. I think we both can do that independently. It needs to be like the format in appendix. 
Indicate original source in comments. and our names in "Modified By"
Think of a real work fractal. 
Save each figure made add title to it that includes our name.
Reproduce Weed-1 fractal in figure 6.5.
Reproduce square spike fractal shown in figure 6.9.
LSystemA should generate all these figures (refer to assignment point 4).
Please read the appendix, to understand commenting. 
We need to look over segments of code to improve it more in terms of efficiency if possible.
